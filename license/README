Libecoli uses the Open Source BSD-3-Clause license. The full
license text can be found in licenses/bsd-3-clause.txt.

Libecoli makes use of Unique License Identifiers, as defined by the SPDX
project (https://spdx.org/):

- it avoids including large license headers in all files
- it ensures licence consistency between all files
- it improves automated detection of licences

The SPDX tag should be placed in the first line of the file when
possible, or on the second line (ex: shell scripts).
